## Loading server list

### Information collected

When you open the Play Online tab, Minetest will request the server list.
The following information will be transferred or included:

* IP address
* Minetest version
* Platform, OS, device, etc

### How it is used

HTTP requests are logged to aid with debugging, development and user
support.
They may also be used to generate anonymized, aggregated user statistics.

### Who has access

sfan5 runs the server list and has access to the logs. Logs with personal
information removed may be shared with others to aid with debugging or
development.

### Period of retention

Logged HTTP requests are stored for up to 3 months.

### Location

The server list is currently located in the Netherlands.
By using this service, you give permission for the data to be moved as needed.


## Browsing Online Content (ContentDB)

You can find more information on
[ContentDB's privacy policy](https://content.minetest.net/privacy_policy/).

### Information collected

Requests to [ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net) will be made when using
the ContentDB dialog found at Content > Browse online content.
The following information will be transferred or included:

* IP address
* Page URL
* Minetest version
* Platform, OS, device, etc

ContentDB will know which packages you view and/or download.

### How it is used

HTTP requests are logged to aid with debugging, development, and aggregated
statistics.

Requests (such as downloads) are used for aggregated statistics and for
calculating the popularity of packages. Download counts are shown for each
package and release, and there are also download graphs available for each
package.

Whether an IP address has downloaded a package or release is cached to prevent
downloads from being counted multiple times per IP address.

### Who has access

rubenwardy runs ContentDB and has access to the logs. Logs with personal
information removed may be shared with others to aid with debugging or
development.

### Period of retention

Logged HTTP requests are stored using log rotation, meaning that any requests
will be forgotten within a few weeks.

### Location

ContentDB is currently located in Germany.
By using this service, you give permission for the data to be moved as needed.

### Removal requests

See [ContentDB's privacy policy](https://content.minetest.net/privacy_policy/#removal-requests).


## Version checking

### Information collected

When you open Minetest, it may contact www.minetest.net to fetch information
about the most recent version. The following information will be transferred or
included:

* IP address
* Minetest version
* Platform, OS, device, etc

### How it is used

The version information is hosted on GitHub Pages.
See [About GitHub Pages > Data collection](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#data-collection):

> When a GitHub Pages site is visited, the visitor's IP address is logged and
> stored for security purposes, regardless of whether the visitor has signed
> into GitHub or not. For more information about GitHub's security practices,
> see
> [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).


## Online play

Minetest allows you to play online on multiplayer game servers. Please note that
game servers are third-party, Minetest acts like a web browser connecting to a
website. Therefore, please refer to the game server's privacy policy.


## Third parties

We do not share any personal information with third parties.


## Future changes to privacy policy

We will alert any future changes to the privacy policy via posts on the
Minetest forum and by the last updated date at the top of this page.
